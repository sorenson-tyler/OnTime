Derivation: Garamond

Garamont’s fonts represent a milestone in the history of type design,
a touchstone to which font designers have been returning ever since.
EB Garamond is an open source project to create a revival of Claude
Garamont’s famous humanist typeface from the mid-16th century.
Its design reproduces the original by Claude Garamont: The source
for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner
specimen”, which, composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, son-in-law of
Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office, shows
Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic fonts at different sizes.
Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.
