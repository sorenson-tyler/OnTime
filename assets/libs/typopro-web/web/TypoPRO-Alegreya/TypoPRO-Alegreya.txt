Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 "Fonts of the Decade" at the ATypI
Letter2 competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type
systems. It was also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de
Diseño, competition held in Madrid in 2010. Alegreya is a typeface
originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics,
it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of
long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to
the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in
a contemporary typographic language. The italic has just as much care
and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are
strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre.
There is also a Small Caps sister family. Not only does Alegreya provide
great performance, but also achieves a strong and harmonious text by
means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity. The Alegreya
type system is a "super family", originally intended for literature, and
includes serif and sans serif sister families.
